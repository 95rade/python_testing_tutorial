# Mock Objects

### Exercise 1: Using a Mock Object

The function **word_report.get_top_words()** requires an instance of the class **TextBody**. You need to test the function, excluding the possibility that the **TextBody** class is buggy. To do so, you need to replace the class by a **Mock Object**, a simple placeholder.

Your task is to write a test for the function **word_counter.get_top_words()** that does not use the class **TextBody**.
