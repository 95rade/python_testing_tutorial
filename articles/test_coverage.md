For the next exercises, you need to install a small plugin:

    pip install pytest-cov


### Exercise 1: Calculate Test Coverage

Calculate the percentage of code covered by automatic tests:

    pytest --cov

### Exercise 2: Identify uncovered lines
Find out which lines are not covered by tests. Execute

    coverage html

And open the resulting `htmlcov/index.html` in a web browser.

### Exercise 3: Increase test coverage

Bring test coverage of **word_counter.py** to 100%.
