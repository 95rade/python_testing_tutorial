# Warming Up

#### How many words are in the following sentence?

    The program works perfectly?

You will probably agree, that the sentence contains **four words**.

----

#### How many words are in the next sentence?

    That #ยง&%$* program still doesn't work!\nI already 
    de-bugged it 3 times, and still numpy.array 
    keeps raising AttributeErrors. What should I do?

You may find the answer to this question less obvious. It depends on how precisely the special characters are interpreted.

### What is automated testing good for?

Writing automated tests for your software helps you to:

* get clear on what you want the program to do.
* identify gaps in the requirements.
* prove the presence of bugs (**not their absence!**).
* help you during refactoring.
