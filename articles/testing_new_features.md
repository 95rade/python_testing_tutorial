# Testing New Features

### Exercise 1: Add new feature: special characters
Add a new feature to the **word_counter.py** program. The program should remove special characters from the text before counting words.

Your task is to prove that the new feature is working.

### Exercise 2: Add new feature: ignore case
Add a new feature to the **word_counter.py** program. The program should ignore the case of words, e.g. *'captain'* and *'Captain'* should be counted as the same word.

Your task is to prove that the new feature is working.

### Exercise 3: Add new feature: word separators
The program **word_counter.py** does separate words at spaces, but not tabulators. You need to change that.

The following sentence should also contain **four** words:

    The\tprogram\tworks\tperfectly.

Your task is to add a test for this new situation and make it work.
