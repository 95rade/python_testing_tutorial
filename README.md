**A Course building Toolkit**

## Contributors

## Overview
This toolkit helps you to prepare training courses on automated testing in Python. It allows you to create courses with interchangeable

* testing frameworks
* background of participants
* course duration

Our aim is to save you preparation time while leaving room for your own ideas. Most of all, we hope you have fun in your next course.

### How to use this toolkit

1. Pick some challenges
2. Decide for a test framework
3. Copy the material in moby_dick/ for your participants
4. Copy the material for your test framework for your course participants
5. Pick exercise material you want to present

### Theme
The content of the course is wrapped into a *Moby Dick* theme: trainees will count frequent words in Melville's book about the white whale. The theme is the driving force that will motivate trainees to keep going.

### The Challenges
Challenges are problem descriptions relevant to the topic of the course. They are related to real-world problems. Challenges are more general than e.g. tasks for trainees. You can adjust challenges to fit to a given difficulty or time frame. They are the raw material to create both *tasks* and *learning objectives*.

### The Tools
Tools are what your trainees will use to solve the challenges. They include: Python programs, code examples, example data etc. Tools are interchangeable. The material given here works with different Python testing frameworks.

### Learning Objective
During the tutorial participants will implement automatic test functions that pass for the Moby Dick example. using the unittest module within 20'.


### Material
* Handout “Introduction to the unittest Framework in Python”
* Slide: Challenge
* Slide: Task description
* TextAnalyser.py
* TestTextAnalyzer.py

## Task Description
What are the 5 words that Melville used the most in Moby Dick?
Extend the TextAnalyser class with a function that returns the five most frequent words from Melvilles “Moby Dick”.
Add a corresponding test function to the TextAnalyserTests module.

Ensure that the test passes.

Testing adds precision to your work.


### Purposes of Testing
* Write code
* debug
* refactor
* maintain software
* teamwork
