# Prototype: Counting Words in Moby Dick

![tick marks while counting words](mobydick.png "Counting words")

## The Challenge

Melvilles book *“Moby Dick”* is about the epic fight between the captain of a whaling ship and a whale. **The whale prevails by eating most of the other characters. But does he also win by being mentioned more often?**

You are to find out whether the whale or the captain is the most frequently mentioned character in the book. You already have a program that counts how often words occur in a text.

**Does the program work correctly?**



### Why was this example selected?

The task easily yields very different results (e.g. because of upper/lower case, special characters etc). Therefore the program needs to be thoroughly tested.
